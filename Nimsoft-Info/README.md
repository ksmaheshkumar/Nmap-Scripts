**DESCRIPTION**<br />
This Nmap script enumerates a CA Nimsoft Robot using the "nimbus" protocol. 
The status information gathered reveals detailed information about the Nimsoft
domain including the robot and hub information, IP addresses, local 
hostnames, the robot mode, the specific OS version including service pack, the 
server architecture, the SSL mode and specific version, among others. 

CA Unified Infrastructure Manager, formerly known as Nimsoft, is a scalable IT
monitoring solution. The solution is typically installed on managed servers, and
communicates using the closed source "nimbus" protocol. 

The commands executed by this script in order to enumerate the target Robot are:
 - _status
 - get_info
 - gethub
 - probe_checkin

The script was tested on versions 7.60 (latest) and 5.x.

**USAGE**<br />
The example output below demonstrates how the script can be used:

```
$ nmap â€”script nimbus-info -n -Pn -p 48000 10.20.0.101
